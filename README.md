# Pingry API

The Pingry API is a place to access online information about Pingry and what is going on through code. It is free and available for all Pingry students to use for personal and school projects.

Please contact Alex Strasser, Aneesh Karuppur, or the Pingry Tech Department for more information on how to use the Pingry API and to get an API key for your project.
